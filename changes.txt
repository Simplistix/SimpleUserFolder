Change & Credit Log

  Version 1.1.0

    - Made Simple User Folder instances ObjectManagers.
      This means configuration methods can now be put in
      the Simpler User Folder, rather than the 
      Simple User Folder's container

    - Renamed 'getUserNames' configuration method to
      'getUserIds' to avoid a name clash brought on
      by the addition of ObjectManager functionality

    - Catered for getUserDetails raising an exception or 
      returning rubbish in a graceful way

    - Documented and tested for the case where editUser is 
      called with a password of None

    - Enabled UsageBase class to test implementations that
      stored encrypted passwords

    - Tidied up tests, SQL tests in particular
